## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM naming conventions

### What I learned

I don't write code since 2013. This project was great to refresh some knowledge (like how to position multiple background images). I never used CSS grids and flexbox before.

### Continued development

CSS grids and flexbox and HTML5 semantic tags.

### Useful resources

- [Controlling background-images | CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&t=368s) - I had difficulties with the positioning of the background images. This tutorial by Kevin Powell helped.
